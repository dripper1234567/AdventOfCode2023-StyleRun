# The Advent of Code (1), Style Run:
* From a premade list, a random language will be chosen (2)
* using that language I will solve the prompt (hopefully during the same day)
* at the end, this git repo will be uploaded to GitHub
Note: Some changes may happen, I want to get this done at a 1 per day-ish pace. And this is just for fun.

*Not the fastest, but certianly interesting.*
